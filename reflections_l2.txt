Situations that involve different versions of the same product or altering
key features could be useful to branch out.

Diagrams help visualise branch structure by seeing how each branch and node are related. It also helps vidualise which commits are about to become unreachable
if they aren't branched out themselves. using the -b tag on that commit will create and then move to a new branch with whatever name you give after the -b tag.:wq

When merging two files - ensure that the latest commit has had any excessive ===== >>>> <<<< removed. This will break your file and are auto-inserted. 

Remember that the branch you are currently in is the 'base' to which the other 
branch will be added.

A con of auto merge is that if you weren't expecting it to fail it really confuses you. By you I mean me. As it was my first time.
